# Machine-Learning. 
 ## Objective 
To build an interactive dashboard that will visually showcase well-curated results of an advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python.  

## Context  
For this Achievement the goal of conducting an exploratory visual analysis in Python and finding connections between variables that seem worth exploring. After developing hypotheses, use various advanced analytical approaches to help test hypotheses.  
The results analyses will be presented in a Tableau dashboard/storyboard. Dashboard will tell the story of analytical journey and, as such, needs to contain a curation of the key results was discovered throughout this Achievement.  

## Project Deliverables  

Below is a breakdown of course project deliverables by Exercise.  

## Exercise 6.1: Sourcing Open Data  
- Source the data by adhering to the requirements stated in the project brief.  
- Complete preparatory steps before moving on to analysis (e.g., cleaning).  
- Define questions to explore based on understanding of what the data contains.  
- Create a document containing details of initial preparatory steps conducted.  

## Exercise 6.2: Exploring Relationships  
- Conduct exploratory visual analysis using relevant Python libraries.  
- Use the questions defined in the previous task to guide your exploration.  
- If possible, define hypotheses to test.  

## Exercise 6.3: Geographical Visualizations with Python  
- Source a shapefile containing location data that corresponds to the location data in the main project data set.  
- Wrangle, clean, and merge data files in preparation for analysis.  
- Conduct a geospatial analysis by creating a choropleth map using relevant Python libraries.  

## Exercise 6.4: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression  
- State hypothesis.  
- Select the relevant variables.  
- Prepare data for a regression analysis.  
- Split the data into two sets: a training set and a test set.  
- Run a linear regression on the data and analyze the model performance statistics.  

## Exercise 6.5: Unsupervised Machine Learning: Clustering  
- Prepare data for a cluster analysis.  
- Use the elbow technique to determine the optimal number of clusters.  
- Run the k-means algorithm.  
- Attach a new column to the dataframe with the resulting clusters.  
- Create a variety of different visualizations using clustered data.  
- Calculate the descriptive statistics for your clusters using the groupby() function and discuss findings and any proposed next steps. 

## Exercise 6.6: Sourcing & Analyzing Time Series Data  
- Source time-series data relevant to project data via an API.  
- Subset data if necessary so that it contains only relevant historical data.  
- Visualize the data in a line plot and decompose its structure.  
- Conduct a Dickey-Fuller test and plot autocorrelations to test for stationarity.  
- Perform differencing to stationarize non-stationary data. 

## Exercise 6.7: Creating Data Dashboards  
- Define the use-case for the dashboard.  
- Outline dashboard contents based on curated results of analysis.  
- Create dashboard/storyboard in Tableau per the requirements in the project brief.  
- Publish a storyboard to Tableau Public.  

## Data Requirements
The data set(s) choose must:  
- Be open-source.  
- Come from an authentic/authoritative source.  
- Include non-anonymized column names.  
- Be recent (ideally, no more than 3 years old. However, this factor is not essential - it could be older too, but not more than 10 years old).  
- Contain at least 2-3 continuous variables (apart from index variables, ID variables, dates, years, etc).  
- Contain at least 2-3 categorical variables (apart from index variables, ID variables, dates, years etc).  
- Contain at least 1,500 rows.  
- Include a geographical object of some kind: for instance, a column relating to a country, continent, or something similar. If the information from the data set refers to the US, for example, there should be a column containing the names/abbreviations of the states.  
**Note:** there should be at least a couple of different values in this column. This is important for the geospatial analysis youâ€™ll be conducting. Of course, can also be used data sets with latitude and longitude.  
- In the course of the Achievement will be sourced a time series data set too, but this procedure will be explained explicitly in the corresponding Exercise.
